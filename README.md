Research Title: Modelling the hospital progression on Delta outbreaks in Australia

Introduction: Since early 2020, all of our lives have been impacted by COVID19. This novel infectious disease has overwhelmed the health care system around the world. In this project, we aim to fit a hospital progression model with some time-series data (from 1/6/2021 to 15/11/2021) of the Delta variant in Australia and use the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method to optimize the model.
