Research Title: Inferring the clinical severity of COVID-19 during Australiaâ€™s Delta wave

Introduction: Since early 2020, all of our lives have been impacted by COVID-19. This novel infectious disease has overwhelmed the health care system around the world. In this project, we aim to fit a hospital progression model with some time-series data of the Delta wave (from 1/6/2021 to 15/11/2021) in Australia via Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).
